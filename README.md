About
I design labyrinths in code — weaving mathematics, art, and narrative into interactive, accessible experiences. From fractal worlds to sacred geometry overlays, my work blends operational rigor with cinematic storytelling.
    • Currently building: anfractus_domus — a winding house of fractals, scripture, and hidden keys 
    • Focus: Reproducibility, Accessibility, Narrative-driven unlocks, Mathematical beauty 
    • Exploring: GPU-accelerated deep zoom, Julia sets, Lorenz attractors, customizable L-systems 
    • Trading: Building RSI_314 — an LSTM model using Relative Strength Index for stock trade analysis 
    • Organizing: Crafting psychic-tribble — a calendar and task management system with logic programming

Philosophy
"Every function is a chamber, every loop a corridor... the labyrinth grows."
I approach codebases as narrative spaces: achievement systems and hidden unlocks reward exploration, mythic Latin naming conventions guide module organization, cinematic structure informs code architecture, and sacred geometry meets practical algorithms.
